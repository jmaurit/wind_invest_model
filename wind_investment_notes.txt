Use of weibull - extreme values - fat tails compared to 

Issue bi-modal distribution of power:
- depends on the choice of wind turbine 
- some may have different power curves
- uncertainty - choose between different wind power based on wind choices
- some may be better at steady, low wind speeds
- some operate better with gusty conditions

Issue of correlation between wind production and power prices
- areas of gusty wind conditions - are these likely to be periods with lots of wind power and lower prices. 
- prior about how future wind prices will be

P = 1/2*rho*A*v^3

A- rotor swept area pi*r^2
rho + air density

Vestas V90 - 3.0 MW
