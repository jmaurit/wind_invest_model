Use of weibull - extreme values - fat tails compared to 

Issue of forming the prior:
-prior based on previous knowledge - are the wind resources good in this area
-Based on general wind map - from met office for example. 

Issue bi-modal distribution of power:
- depends on the choice of wind turbine 
- some may have different power curves
- uncertainty - choose between different wind power based on wind choices
- some may be better at steady, low wind speeds
- some operate better with gusty conditions

Issue of correlation between wind production and power prices
- areas of gusty wind conditions - are these likely to be periods with lots of wind power and lower prices. 
- prior about how future wind prices will be

P = 1/2*rho*A*v^3

A- rotor swept area pi*r^2

V100-2.0 MW™ at a Glance
The V100-2.0 MW™ IEC IIB turbine allows you to increase productivity by opening up low- and medium-wind sites which were previously regarded as non-viable. To maximise power output at such locations, the turbines' 100 m rotor gains more from the available wind – starting at an incredibly low 3 m/s. Thanks to the 49 m blades, the turbines deliver a notable rotor-to-generator ratio producing a remarkable capacity and yield at low- and medium-wind sites.
